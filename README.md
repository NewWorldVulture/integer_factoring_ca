It's a cellular automata that factors integers. You need to run it first to figure out how many generations it takes to factor it, and to see how many columns you need, because PIL needs to know in advance, as far as I knew in 2021. I will not be updating this again, probably

It takes a "command" in the form `FXXXX`. It then copies the number, and initializes a set of columns, D, that will be iterating from 1 to `XXXX`. At this point, the tape looks like `XXXXcXXXX.DDDDf`. For example, `0110c0110.0001f`.

Quite a lot of the machinery in the cellular automata is just responsible for the initialization described above. I could've saved something like 15 states by requiring the initial tape to be the above.


The CA then subtracts `DDDD` from the second copy of `XXXX`, producing `SSSS`. Then the CA checks if `SSSS` is greater than zero. If it is, it subtracts `DDDD` again. When it subtracts, if it attempts to borrow from the `c` column (meaning that `DDDD` is greater than `SSSS`), it errors out (purple) and it knows that `XXXX` is not divisible by `DDDD`.

If `XXXX` is divisible by `DDDD`, it sends a message to copy `DDDD` over to the factors. While it does this, it writes over `SSSS` with `XXXX` again. Tape is now `XXXXcXXXX.DDDDfDDDD`. Whether it copies it or not, it then adds 1 to DDDD. It repeats this process until `DDDD` is equal to `XXXX`

Backing up to subtraction, after a copy is triggered, if the first subtraction performed brings `SSSS` to zero (meaning that `DDDD` is equal to `XXXX`, it immediately copies `DDDD` to the factors columns, and wipes all the colums to the left of `f`, only leaving the factors behind.
